# GoCRUD Documentation

Welcome to the **GoCRUD** documentation! This guide will help you understand how to use GoCRUD to build powerful, scalable, and maintainable CRUD APIs with ease.

## üìñ Overview

### Key Features

-   **Automatic CRUD Generation**: Generate RESTful endpoints for your models with minimal configuration.
-   **Input Validation**: Built-in validation for your model fields.
-   **Customizable Hooks**: Add custom logic before or after CRUD operations.
-   **Future-Ready**: Designed to support relationships and advanced features in upcoming versions.
